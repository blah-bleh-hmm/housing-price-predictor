# 🏠 Housing Price Predictor 🔢

A machine learning-powered web app that predicts housing prices based on user input like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Built with Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.

This project was created to learn full stack development by combining an ML model with a functional web interface.
